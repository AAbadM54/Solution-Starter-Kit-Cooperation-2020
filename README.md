## Overview

### What's the problem?

In times of crisis, such as COVID-19, while federal and local government may be rolling out broad programs, cooperation at the local level is usually the most effectibe way of getting help to where it is most needed. While traditional social media is one way of communicating within a community, this is (by its very design) not locally focused, and often not sufficently structured to enable rapid discover of help needed. In the COVID-19 crisis we have already seen problems with the local supply of food, equipment and other supplies. In addition, due to self-isolation and social distancing, the inablity of people to easily get to where the best stock of supplies may be held compounds the problem. This is a growing interest in communities' cooperating amoung themsleves to solve these problems, whether it be to advertise where stock is held, offer assitance for collections or other local services. What is needed is the something to empower communities to easily to provide this to each other.

### How can technology help?

Mobile, Web and Cloud services enable rapid deployment of applications that can empower cooperation in the community. Watson Assistant is a service on IBM Cloud that allows us to build, train, and deploy conversational interactions into any application, device, or channel. Creating a chatbot using Watson Assistant can help address the issues that our users can face while trying to gather the right information. Embedding loaction/routing services (like [HERE](https://developer.here.com/products/routing)) can enhance such applications, giving optimum guidance so that they are outside of their isolation location for the minimum amount of time.

## The idea


## How it works


## Diagrams

[WIP - needs refining]

![Cooperation architecture diagram](/images/architecture-diagram.png)

This solution starter idea combines machine learning and location services with real-time information to get users the information they need.

[WIP - needs refining]

1. The user launches the mobile app and can access information across multiple services.
1. The user can ask questions to Watson Assistant and get answers on food/service availabilty questions.
1. The user can post availability of stcok or services they can provide.
1. The user can obtain geolocation data to plot routes to collect (or drop off) supplies using HERE Location Services.

## Getting started

### Prerequisite

- Register for an [IBM Cloud](cloud.ibm.com/registration/) account.

### Steps

[WIP - needs refining]

1. [Set up an instance of Watson Assistant](#1-set-up-an-instance-of-watson-assistant).


### 1. Set up an instance of Watson Assistant
Log in to IBM Cloud and provision a Watson Assistant instance.

1. Provision an instance of **Watson Assistant** from the [IBM Cloud catalog](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/services/watson-assistant).
1. Launch the Watson Assistant service.
1. [Create an **Assistant**](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-assistant-add).
1. [Add a dialog skill](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-skill-dialog-add) to the **Assistant** by importing the [`starter-kit-flood-dialog-skill.json`](./starter-kit/assistant/starter-kit-flood-dialog-skill.json) file.
1. Go back to All Assistants page, open **Settings** from the action menu ( **`â‹®`** ) and click on **API Details**.
1. Note the **Assistant ID** and **API Key**.
1. Go to **Preview Link** to get a link to test and verify the dialog skill.
